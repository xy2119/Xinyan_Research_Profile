									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a type of neural network that are designed to process data that is represented in the form of a graph. In a graph <span class="math inline">ùí¢‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ(ùí±, ‚Ñ∞)</span> , the data is represented as a set of nodes (also called vertices)  <span class="math inline"><em>i</em>‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑùí±</span> , and the connections between the nodes are represented as edges <span class="math inline">(<em>i</em>, <em>j</em>)‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑ‚Ñ∞</span>. GNNs operate on graphs by passing messages between the nodes in the graph. These messages are used to update the representation of each node, aggregating the representations of its neighboring nodes. This process of message passing is repeated over multiple layers, with each layer updating the node representations based on the representations of its neighbors in the previous layer. Given feature <span
class="math inline"><em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><sup><em>l</em></sup></span>
on node <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and edge feature
<span
class="math inline"><em>e</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub><sup><em>l</em></sup></span>
at the <span class="math inline"><em>l</em></span>-th layer, it first
aggregates messages <span
class="math inline"><em>m</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub><sup><em>l</em></sup></span>
from neighbors and then update features on each node as follows:</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55"><span
class="math display"><em>m</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub><sup><em>l</em></sup>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>œï</em><sub><em>m</em></sub>(<em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><sup><em>l</em></sup>,<em>f</em><sub><em>j</em></sub><sup><em>l</em></sup>,<em>e</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub><sup><em>l</em></sup>)‚Ää‚ÄÅ
and
‚Ää‚ÄÅ<em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><sup><em>l</em>‚ÄÖ+‚ÄÖ1</sup>‚ÄÑ=‚ÄÑ<em>œï</em><sub><em>u</em></sub>(<em>f</em><sub><em>i</em></sub><sup><em>l</em></sup>,‚àë<sub><em>j</em>‚ÄÑ‚àà‚ÄÑùí©(<em>i</em>)</sub><em>m</em><sub><em>i</em><em>j</em></sub><sup><em>l</em></sup>)</span></p>
<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">where <span class="math inline">ùí©(<em>i</em>)</span> denotes the set
of neighbors of node <span class="math inline"><em>i</em></span> and
<span class="math inline"><em>œï</em><sub><em>m</em></sub></span> and

									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">They are well suited for property prediction of atomic systems because they can handle both discrete and topological structures, which are commonly found in atomic systems. There are two main ways to represent atomic systems as graphs: 2D chemical bond graphs and 3D spatial graphs. 2D Chemical bond graphs, represent atomic systems as a set of nodes, with each node representing an atom, and edges representing chemical bonds between atoms. These graphs capture the chemical structure of the system, but do not consider the spatial arrangement of the atoms. 3D spatial graphs, on the other hand, represent atomic systems as a set of nodes arranged in 3D space, with edges representing the spatial relationships between the nodes. These graphs enabled representation of the geometric relationships between atoms in a molecule or crystal, but the key challenge in moving from 2D chemical bonding graphs to 3D spatial graphs is to remain invariant or equivalent to the geometric transformations acting on atom positions, in other words, be equivariant to the Euclidean group E(3) of rigid motions (rotations, translations, and reflections) in addition to the standard permutation equivariance.</p>

									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">Invariant neural networks and equivariant neural networks are types of neural networks that have been proposed for use with 3D atomistic graphs.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">Invariant neural networks operate on invariant information, such as distances and angles between atoms. This means that they are designed to produce the same output regardless of the orientation or position of the atomic system in space. This can be useful for predicting properties that are independent of the orientation of the atomic system, such as its energy levels or bond lengths.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">Equivariant neural networks, on the other hand, operate on geometric tensors like type-L vectors. These tensors encode information about the orientation and position of the atomic system in space, and the neural network is designed to be equivariant to changes in the orientation and position of the atomic system. This can be useful for predicting properties that depend on the orientation of the atomic system, such as its vibrational frequencies or electromagnetic properties.</p>

									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">In previous work, invariant graph neural networks constructed for 3D atomic graphs can be divided to reply on different geometric information such as distances [SchNet,], bond angles [DimeNet] or dihedral angles [SphereNet, GemNet], and symmetry groups [Equiformer]. Our work falls into the category of exploring equivariant irreps features to consider directional information to reduce the dimension of representation and therefore simplify graph structure of generic GNNs.</p>

										<p id="2" style="font-size:25px; color:#484d55">Protein Structure Determination</p>
									</header>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">While experimentally determined protein structures provide valuable information for drug design and discovery, the process of obtaining these structures can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. The preparation of pure, stable protein samples is an important step in the process, and the experimental techniques themselves, such as X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy, can also be time-consuming. Once the structures have been determined, they are typically deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) as coordinate files for future reference and use in research and development. Despite the challenges, the use of experimentally determined protein structures as a starting point for drug design and discovery has led to significant advances in the field.</p>

										<p id="3" style="font-size:25px; color:#484d55">Traditional and Deep Learning Approaches in Protein Design</p>
									</header>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">Traditional protein design seeks to maximize P(sequence|structure)
by minimizing the energy of the target structure by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based search over side chain identities and conformations. The energy function is based on a combination of physical and statistical potentials, which are different types of energy terms that can be used to describe the behavior of the system. Physical potentials are based on physical laws and principles, such as the laws of motion and thermodynamics. They describe the energy of a system based on the positions, velocities, and other physical properties of the individual particles or atoms that make up the system. On the other hand, statistical potentials are based on statistical analysis of the properties of a large number of similar systems. They are used to approximate the energy of a particular system based on the probability that it will have certain properties or behavior. The capacity to generate diverse sequences and design multi-body interactions is a fundamental weakness of traditional protein design approaches. These restrictions have been lifted by deep learning approaches, which now provide enhanced design options.</p>

									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">Deep learning is a type of artificial intelligence that is built on two key principles: representation learning, and learning through local gradient descent using backpropagation. In representation learning, the algorithm adapts features to capture the regularities relevant to a specific task, regularities refer to patterns or structures in the data. These features can be organized into levels, with each level representing a different level of abstraction. The second principle, learning through local gradient descent, involves updating the parameters of the model in small steps based on the error between the predicted and actual output. This process is called backpropagation.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">One challenge in deep learning is the "curse of dimensionality," which refers to the difficulty of learning generic functions in high-dimensional spaces. Given that the physical world has pre-defined regularities that arise from the underlying structure, exploiting these regularities, which often reflect the symmetries of a large system, can help to address the curse of dimensionality, which also forms the basis of many physical theories. The secret to breaking the curse lies in adapting neural networks to use low-dimensional geometry generated by physical measurements, for example, a grid in an image, a sequence in a time series, or position and structure in a molecule, and their associated symmetries, such as translations or rotations.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">In our case, we will leverage the underlying principle of geometric regularity of protein to construct representation, and test the effect on a state-of-the-art neural network architecture, called ProteinMPNN.</p>
