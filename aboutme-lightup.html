										<h2>Breaking Free: My Journey of Defying Limitations and Finding My Passion in AI</h2>
										
									</header>
									
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">Growing up, I always felt like I was trapped in a cage of other people's underestimations. In secondary school, my teachers told me that girls didn't need to be good at maths, and I was determined to prove them wrong. Six months later, I scored perfectly in math and rose to the top of my school overall. But that was just the beginning. When my dad suggested I take the easy route and get a diploma in management, I refused to accept the limitations others were trying to place on me. Instead, I applied to study science and engineering in high school, something I had always been passionate about. Six months later, I received an offer from a top 10 global university to study engineering, finishing high school a year early and committing to university.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">It wasn't until I got to university that I encountered another challenge. Many of my fellow majors believed it was impossible to balance our major courses with non-credit computer science courses, and gave up on the idea of exploring AI. But I was not convinced, and I set out to prove them wrong. I devoted myself to learning math and statstis for machine learning, reaching out to the computer science department to sit in AI courses and participating in a series of competitions to hone my practical skills. And one year later, my efforts paid off, as I received offers from both the industry for data mining and the computer science department for a research assistant position.</p>
									<p style="font-size:20px; color:#484d55">Throughout my journey, I have always been motivated by the desire to prove others wrong and to achieve my own goals. And in the process of developing AI-enabled applications, I have found a sense of fulfillment that goes beyond just the technical challenges. The awe and gratitude of the users who benefit from my work gives me a sense of purpose, and the respect I have earned in the workplace, regardless of my gender and identity, is something I am deeply proud of. AI has become a source of joy and inspiration for me, and I am grateful to have found something that allows me to easily enter a ‘flow state’ and feel truly alive.</p>
